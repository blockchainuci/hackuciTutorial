A simple ethereum blockchain application using of solidity, smart contracts, and the truffle framework for introductory blockchain development.

INSTALLATION:

1. Node environment:
    
        brew install node

2. Solc Compiler: Ethereum smart contracts are compiled with this.
    
        npm install -g solc

3. Go Ethereum (geth): a multipurpose command line tool that runs a full Ethereum node implemented in Go.
    
        1.brew tap ethereum/ethereum

        2.brew install ethereum

4. Truffle framework: Truffle is development environment and test framework for ethereum. You can install truffle using npm.
    
        npm install -g truffle

5. Ganache-cli: creates a virtual Ethereum blockchain, and it generates some fake accounts that we will use during development
    
        npm install -g ganache-cli

6. Install dependencies
